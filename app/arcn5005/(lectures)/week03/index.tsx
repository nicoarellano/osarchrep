       GUIs are human-computer interaction devices that allow users to interact with the computer through graphical icons instead of written code.\
       With a GUI the user can click or touch and manipulate the symbols displayed on the screen and thus, directly alter the program.\
       GUIs made computer more accessible for non-programmers, including architects.\
       Since then, GUIs are certainly the preferred vehicle for architects to interact with computers.',

The same algorithms are used to calculate shape, normals, tangents, curvatures and other properties by way of control points, weights and degree. In the case of NURBS surfaces, there are two directions implied by the geometry, because NURBS surfaces are, regardless of the shape we see, rectangular grids of control points. And even though these directions are often arbitrary relative to the world coordinate system, we will use them frequently to analyze our models or generate other geometry based on the Surface. - Source: Dynamo Primer'
