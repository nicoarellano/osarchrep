        <h5>
          Julie Ivanoff is a PhD Student and holds a Master’s of Architectural
          Studies at Carleton University. She is an expert in Digital Twins,
          focusing on the positive impacts of digital twin in urban development.
          In her research she dives into the history of digital twins, and how
          they are currently used today . Her exploration of digital twins
          around the world urges viewers to imagine a digital twin as a tangible
          reality of the future. Julie holds an expertise in Architecture. In
          her thesis in the Master of Architectural Studies program at Carleton
          University, she studied the UK’s national digital twin initiative. She
          is also been a long-time researcher and Team Lead at the Carleton
          Immersive Media Studio (CIMS) on the project Imagining Canada’s
          Digital Twin.

    A program usually starts out as source code. This higher-level set of commands \
