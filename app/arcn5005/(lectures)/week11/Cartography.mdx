## Fundamental objectives of traditional cartography

- Select traits of the object to be mapped
  - Physical, such as roads
  - Abstract, such as political boundaries
- Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media → projections.
- Eliminate the mapped object's characteristics that are irrelevant to the map's purpose and reduce complexities→ generalization.
- Orchestrate the elements of the map to best convey its message to its audience. This is the concern of map design.
