      'However, before the end of 2019 to imagine an alternative to proprietary software for the AEC industry was challenging.\n\
      The industry was (and still is) too dependant on the main vendorâ€™s solutions.\n\
      But then, a chain of events started to open the door to alternatives\n\
      â†’ In October 2019 Dion Moult releases BlenderBIM\n\
      â†’ In February 2020, the OS Arch is created: OSArch,, is an online community that promotes that the built environment can be designed, constructed, operated, and recycled withÂ free/libre and open-source software.\n\
      â†’ In July 2020, several leading UK and international AEC firms wrote an open letter to Autodeskâ€™ demanding changes related to costs, licensing & business practices\n\
      â†’ In December 2020 the IFC.js library is released. The first FLOSS online library to work with BIM and IFC.\n\
      â†’ In September 2022 there is a follow-up letter by the Nordic Architectural Associations endorsed by  the Architectsâ€™ council of Europe. \n\
      â†’ We donâ€™t know about 2023 but I believe this is the year for CIMSâ€¦\n\
      â†’ In my opinion, instead of writing letters to the vendors we as sector need to keep taking action with our own hands.',
