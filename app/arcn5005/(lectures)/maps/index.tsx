        The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as \
        the surface of the earth in a cartographic map or an atlas, or three dimensional, such as a world globe. \
        Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory \
        have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word map \
        comes from the medieval Latin: Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin \
        or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, map became a shortened term \
        referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the \

Many astronomical and navigational computations use a sphere to model the Earth as a close approximation. However, a more accurate figure is needed for measuring distances and areas on the scale beyond the purely local. Better approximations can be made by modeling the entire surface as an oblate spheroid, using spherical harmonics to approximate the geoid, or modeling a region with a best-fit reference ellipsoid. \
      For surveys of small areas, a planar (flat) model of Earth's surface suffices because the local topography overwhelms the curvature. Plane-table surveys are made for relatively small areas without considering the size and shape of the entire Earth. A survey of a city, for example, might be conducted this way. \

    notes:
      "NAD83 (North American Datum 1983) is a geodetic reference system used in North America for mapping and surveying. It is the primary reference system for all mapping and surveying activities in Canada, the United States, and Mexico and is based on a network of survey markers. \
      NAD83 is based on a survey marker network that was developed across North America between 1984 and 1991. These markers were used to create a geodetic reference frame that accounts for the flaws in the Earth's form caused by local variations in gravity and tectonic plate movement. As a result, NAD83 is more accurate in North America than the WGS84 system. \
      ==================================================================== \
      WGS 84 determines the Earth's orientation in space by describing its rotation and position relative to the celestial sphere with a set of parameters. The rotational velocity of the Earth, its orientation relative to a fixed reference frame, and the position of the Earth's centre of mass are among these factors. \
      WGS 84 contains a global network of ground control points that offer constant and accurate measurements of the earth's surface. These ground control points are used to precisely locate a GPS receiver and calculate the coordinates of features on the earth's surface. \
      WGS84 is the standard reference system for many mapping and navigation applications, such as aviation, maritime navigation, and surveying. GPS satellites use WGS-84 as the reference system for their orbital features and clock corrections, allowing GPS receivers to identify their position on the Earth's surface with pinpoint accuracy. \
      The WGS 84 ellipsoid is the mathematical model of the Earth's shape that is used as a reference surface for geographic coordinates. The semi-major axis and flattening of an ellipsoid are both measured in metres. The semi-major axis represents the ellipsoid's equatorial radius, whereas the flattening represents the difference between the polar and equatorial radii divided by the equatorial radius. \
      Overall, WGS-84 is important in enabling accurate and dependable navigation and mapping around the world. It is constantly maintained and updated to account for changes in the Earth's shape and mass distribution, ensuring that it remains a reliable reference system for many years to come.",

      "If you need 3D, then Cesium is the place to start. True, MapLibre can provide some basic 3D terrain, but Cesium can give you full control of camera angles and allow users to spin around the location in view. It does a great job rendering topography (including 3D building cityscapes) and they’ve even started work on VR support.\
      Cesium is also great for its timing features. A built in clock control allows you start and stop playback of recorded data, as well fast forward, rewind, or slide across a timeline. You can even automate this by assigning availability times to features. In fact, Cesium takes it ones step further by including the positions of the sun and other celestial objects based on your timestamps. This can all be done through the JavaScript API, or by defining everything in a CZML file. If you want realistic 3D playback of position data, then Cesium is likely your best choice. \
      On top of these features, Cesium also maintains the usual set of GIS features that you’d expect from a mapping library and can present a 2D view if preferred. \
      Look into Resium, for use in React. Source: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/5-javascript-mapping-libraries-when-to-use-them-961ff6366d0b",

While the core Leaflet API handles the basic 2D map needs with ease, it may not address all the latest GIS technologies. This is where the plugins and extension from third party developers come in handy. There are plugins for vector tiles, Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs (COG), drawing ad hoc geometries, overlaying heat maps and so much more.\
      What this all means in practice is that you can start with Leaflet quickly and easily and if you find that your needs grow, there are likely to be plugins to help Leaflet grow with you. If quick and flexible development are your goals, then Leaflet is a great choice. If you know that you have specific needs for newer technologies and want a library with native support for those requirements then you may also want to consider one of the following options in the your search. \

    MapLibre is the open source fork of MapBox GL.

This is especially true when it comes to creating, styling, or serving vector tiles. However, their flagship web map library recently moved into a more commercial role, so MapLibre was born to continue serving the open source community. \
    As you might guess, it specializes in many of the technologies that MapBox has championed over the years, including vector tiles. It also provides a pseudo-3D tilted camera view. I’ve even seen video overlays on this platform. If you want to see the bleeding edge, you will often find it from the folks at MapBox and/or MapLibre. \
