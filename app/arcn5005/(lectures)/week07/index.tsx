        <h5>
          Rapha√´l Vouilloz is a Swiss architect based in Lausanne. He graduated
          from the Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne in Architecture,
          Urban and Territorial Design. His master thesis was supervised by
          Prof. Bernard Cache and focused on BIM uses for transforming existing
          buildings: digital survey, phasing and planning. He joined the
          laboratory for Digital Cultures of the Architectural Project
          laboratory (CNPA) as a scientific assistant for teaching geometry and
          stereotomy on parametric software and BIM, as well as for research and
          development oriented towards open formats and open-source tools for
          architects, such as Speckle, IFC.js and BonsaiBIM (formerly
          BlenderBIM). He is doing a PhD under the co-direction of Prof. Bernard
          Cache and Philippe Marin, of the M√©thodes et Histoire de
          l`Architecture (MHA) laboratory at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure
          d`Architecture de Grenoble (ENSAG). His research involves defining
          digital BIM and CAD/CAM processes for ashlar construction, prototyping
          a model of the horseshoe-shaped staircase at the Ch√¢teau de
          Fontainebleau.

    automated checking, and publishing can be achieved by hosting IFC data in established commercial and open source git-forge services.\n\
    It shows that the git revision control system as a Common Data Environment (CDE) for BIM data is scalable, secure, future-proof and fully interoperable with existing systems. \n\
    It shows multiple software applications and libraries that already implement *Native IFC*, this is a real-world technology.',
