            <h3>ID selectors</h3>
            <h5>

              <br />
              To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#)
              character, followed by the id of the element. <br /> example:
              <b className="text-red-500">#page-title {'{color: red;}'}</b>

            <h5>
              The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class
              attribute. <br />
              To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.)
              character, followed by the class name. <br /> example:
              <b className="text-red-500">.pages {'{color: red;}'}</b>

    notes:
      '1. BY NAME: Browsers support some colors by their name. Table shows names, hexadecimal code, values in RGB, HSL formats and description. \n\n\
      2. HEX: Hexadecimal colors are based, on the number 16. The numbers are as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. \
      Numbers from 10 to 15 are replaced by Latin letters. Numbers which are greater than 15 in the hexadecimal system are formed by combining two numbers into one. \
      For example, the number 255 in the decimal system corresponds to FF value in the hexadecimal system. \
      In order to avoid confusion in the definition of the number system, the hexadecimal number is preceded by octothorp, for example # 666999 or 0x... in JavaScript. \
      Each of three colors - red, green and blue - can take the value from 00 to FF. \
      Thus, color representation is divided into three #rrggbb components, where the first two characters represent the red component of the color, two others in the middle represent green, and the last two represent blue. \
      It is acceptable to use the abbreviated form of #rgb coding type, where each character has to be doubled. Thus, the code # fe0 is to be considered as # ffee00.\n\n\
      3. RGB+a: The color can be defined by using red, green, and blue components in decimal value. Each of three color components takes value from 0 to 255. It is also possible to set the color percentagewise with 100% corresponding to the number 255. At first the rgb keyword to be indicated, \
      and then color components within the brackets and separated by a comma, for example rgb (255, 128, 128) or rgb (100%, 50%, 50%). \
      The RGBA format is similar to RGB in syntax, but includes the alpha channel that specifies the transparency of the element. The value 0 corresponds to full transparency, the value 1 to opacity, and the intermediate value like 0.5 to translucency. \n\n\
      4. HSL+a: Hue, Saturate and Lightness. Hue is the color value on the color wheel and is measured in degrees. 0° corresponds to red, 120 ° to green, and 240 ° to blue. The hue value can vary from 0 to 359. \
      Saturation is the intensity of the color, measured in percentages from 0% to 100%. The value of 0% means the absence of the color and the shade of gray, the value of 100% means the maximum value of saturation. \
      Lightness specifies how bright the color is and is measured in percentages from 0% to 100%. Small values make the color darker, and high values make the color lighter, values of 0% and 100% correspond to black and white.',

        <h4>
          In CSS, the term <em>box model</em> is used when talking about design
          and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around
          every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the
          actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

    notes:
      'The flexible box layout module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides. \n\
 When we describe flexbox as being one-dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.',
