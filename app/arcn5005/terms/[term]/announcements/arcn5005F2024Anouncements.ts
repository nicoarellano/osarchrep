      "2024/09/21: Hi all, someone noticed that MeshRoom is not available for Mac OS. \
      It is a shame that they have not developed a version for Mac. They explain that it has something to do with the graphics engine. \
But don't worry, it is not going to be an issue for the rest of the term. This is the only time we are going to use a photogrammetric software, and it could be any. \
1. Partner with someone that has Windows or Linux OS and just process your photos there, or \
2. You can use the 1-month free trial of Agisoft Metashape that does the same: https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/ \
Here is an example of using Metashape with Blender: https://youtu.be/rc4pUHolxgA?si=uhBv7dlkNm4RYgRz \
3. Whatever software works for you. Just do the research. I don't really care about the software, I just want you to be able to get a mesh. \
Please let me know if you have further questions.",

    title: `Hi All, First of all, thanks to all of you who have submitted your assignment 1. 
    I am really enjoying them. Most of them are very creative and fun. I hope you also enjoyed creating them.
 I will be accepting submissions until the end of the day today (Friday, October 20th), there are still 5 students who have not submitted yet. Please submit ASAP.
 If you are still unsure how to submit it, please&nbsp;review again the video where I explain 4 different ways of submitting, or ask your classmates.
 Please review what I have received so far here:
 https://reposarch.vercel.app/arcn5005/terms/f2024/students
 What you see on that link is all I have so far, so if you are not satisfied with the result or if you are missing an image or something (for example the avatar.jpg) you have until the end of the day (Friday, October 20th at 11:59 pm) to upload it.
 I gave you some feedback yesterday that you have to address if you want a full mark, but also try to improve based on your classmates' submissions.
 Any submission after tonight will be penalized. However, you can keep improving your page until the end of the term. If the improvement is substantial, I may consider giving you some extra points.
 I hope the first part of the class was interesting to all of you.&nbsp;
 Enjoy your break and see you in 2 weeks!`,

      "Thanks all for the great effort placed on Assignment 2. \
      I know it was a hard one. I understand that this is all very new for most of you so I understand if some of you get a bit frustrated. Is all part of the process and it is the only way of learning how to code, by facing hard problems in a short period of time. I hope you are learning and enjoying the results.     \
      If you still have big questions about the assignment, please send me an email and I can make myself available tomorrow morning (Friday, Nov 17th) for Zoom calls. I am extending the deadline until the end of Saturday for you to take your time and submit the best you can.&nbsp; \
      For those who have already submitted and are not completely happy about the submission, feel free to ask me more questions and submit again. \
      Remember that your submission must look different to my example. Now that you know how it works, please be creative and have fun with it (see for example Filipe's, Daphne's, Mikhala, Jenny, Cole, Evan, Jeremy, Keegan, Melanie, etc). There are great examples out there (that can also be improved if you want), take a look and learn from each other. Please revisit Assignment 1 and grab ideas from it, buttons, animations, background, etc. Make a good composition using both assignments. \
      I know that I didn't have time to talk about assignment 3, but don't worry, I will rearrange the dates so we are able to submit everything. We will talk about that next class. \
      Have a great weekend and see you next Thursday.",
