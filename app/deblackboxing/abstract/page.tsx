          architecture. <span className="br-md" />
          Since the 1970s, when computers became available to architects, this
          new human-computer relationship became a revolution for architecture
          in multiple fundamental aspects, such as representation, education,
          and practice. Half a century later, in the 2020s computers are not
          only available, but in most cases, they are indispensable.

          The research recognizes actors, processes and milestones that have led
          architects into the scenario that we are in today where a handful of
          software vendors control the majority of the tools that architects use
          to design, build and manage buildings. Monopolistic practices such as{' '}

          Software are sets of programs that have a specific function.
          Originally, back in the 50s, software were open systems written in
          human readable programming language that could be studied and modified
          by their users, however, software vendors created methods to prevent
          the free distribution of their products. The term open-software was

          However, architects are behind. The bast majority of the practice is
          done through proprietary software, which hinders collaboration,

          The term <q>black box</q> to describe opaque computer processes has

          <sup>2</sup>. Digital objects are coded to describe and represent
          real-life building components. This facilitates a dialog with the
          model that was previously not possible. BIM could be defined as a
          communication and collaboration tool originally created to connect
          people, processes, and data. However, that is not exactly the way the
          Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry is using
          BIM. The status quo is to work with proprietary solutions and closed
          file formats. There are a few vendors that control the industry
          usually, promoting their own proprietary file formats. The issue is
          that when working with closed formats, the whole process becomes a
          black box.
          <span className="br-md" />
          <strong>Two conditions</strong> must be met before architects can
          attempt to de-blackbox the digital toolbox. Firstly, architects must
          have a working knowledge of computer programming. Secondly, the source
          code—the list of human-readable instructions that define a computer
          program—of the software that they use must be accessible for
          modification by the user.
          <span className="br-md" />
          This research explores both obstacles—
          <strong>digital oblivion</strong> and <strong>black-boxes</strong>
          —that architects must overcome in order to benefit from a fruitful
          relationship between programming and architecture. .{' '}

          Coding has the potential to further expand the current limits of our
          imagination. Computers are a tremendous contribution to our
